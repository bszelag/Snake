WARNING:Xst:647 - Input <PointsB> is never used. This port will be preserved and left unconnected if it belongs to a top-level block or it belongs to a sub-block and the hierarchy of this sub-block is preserved.
INFO:Xst:2117 - HDL ADVISOR - Mux Selector <points_10$mux0000> of Case statement line 553 was re-encoded using one-hot encoding. The case statement will be optimized (default statement optimization), but this optimization may lead to design initialization problems. To ensure the design works safely, you can:
   	- add an 'INIT' attribute on signal <points_10$mux0000> (optimization is then done without any risk)
   	- use the attribute 'signal_encoding user' to avoid onehot optimization
   	- use the attribute 'safe_implementation yes' to force XST to perform a safe (but less efficient) optimization

If you are doing this on purpose, you may safely ignore this warning. Otherwise, make sure you are not losing information, leading to unexpected circuit behavior.
